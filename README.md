The 2025 Soul Foundation Symposium.
Good afternoon. As most of you know, about 15 years ago, there was a large project in Las Vegas 
funded by the defense department. And within that program I helped develop a data warehouse of 
about 260,000 unexplained cases. Most of them at the beginning from my files based on files of 
other people and my own research that I had started to reformat into a single format so that we 
can begin to do AI to put an AI level on top of it. That did not happen. And there were some 
exceptional cases within that. So for the last 15 years I have been working at those cases in 
a different way. With a different set of of lenses to look at truly exceptional cases that
were either exceptions or validations of things that were in advance of our current ideas about 
what the phenomena was like. 

So, I'm going to talk about just one case from beginning to end and then
show you so it's going to be essentially physics physics that you could present in high
school today from again from beginning to end but then as you'll see it will
lead to some ideas for the future that
have some interest. So at at the outset I feel obligated to
apologize for such a simple story compared to some of the other things
that you've heard. There is no alien in my talk. There is no abduction.
There isn't even any hanky panky by the air force or anybody
else in the government and it's not classified. It was never classified and
you've probably never heard of it.
We together with Mr. Luke Denny and
the Cha Meshski in in France in the same group
and the uh the college of experts of Sigma 2.
We submitted our research on this case to progress in aerospace sciences
and it was published earlier this year. So I'm not going to go through all the
details. All the details and the formulas have already been published. We're very proud of being accepted by
that review because it is the dominant it is the number one review in
essentially aerospace in the world today and that had really never been done
except for one other case that Dr. Nolan and I had published before which had
also been pretty much unknown before.
In terms of academic consideration, this is mainstream physics.
We have the essential data. It was published early.

The case took place in 1966 and the it has been studied and I'll
will go through very quickly through the history of how it was studied at the
time and then the conclusions were reviewed by the American Academy of
Sciences in an official report that nobody has read.
And there are good reasons for that. And there are sociological reasons, not scientific reasons. And here we
beginning to see the true components of why we're here.
There is no other case with the kind of credentials that I'm going to show you in the history of
ufology. The skeptics have given up a long time ago. I mean they wouldn't go after me or
after the scientists involved. they would have to go after the academy of sciences of the United States of America.
And, so far, they haven't done that. So to explore the the question and to
reopen the case in a new direction we've assembled a small team in France
and I'm very grateful to you look for what you were able to to bring into 
the research to do an updated study because there have been
new information. There has been new information along the way.

So this is essentially the nucleus of the team in France. This is at the at
the aviation uh museum in Paris. 
the the case is old again 1966. So uh I mentioned
it on the internet and there was in three different conferences about UFOs
and nobody followed up. There were a couple of people with questions. Nobody followed up because who cares? We want
to chase ambulances today. Okay. We want to know what's happening with the
latest light in the sky or latest picture of something for which there is
essentially no information that of a scientific value but there could be.
So, the case is old but the conclusions have been in print widely in
the United States again since 1970 and they are becoming important for us
again in the current climate.

So this uh symposium of soul here in Italy
demonstrates that we're at the beginning of a completely new phase
with new tools and these new tools have been
inspired by the late professor Peter Stur at Stanford University
and pursued now by Dr. Noland and and and his team and by Dr. Kevin Kof at
Colombia University and by the Sigma 2 commission in France. So there are now
several large organizations that are harnessed to the solution of this
problem. I have one hour less than an hour.

My presentation will be in two parts. I will go quickly through the case itself
as it stands and then the current assessment of it and then after that we'll consider with you the
implications and take your questions about the and I will bring in some
questions of my own that I've had all along since I have the the
opportunity to do that. The major facts of the case are on record. So
there is very little left to the imagination as you will see.

I first heard of the case when I was
at Northwestern University near Chicago early in '67. I was
finishing a doctorate in AI. Yes, AI goes back to you know the mid 60s.
Between the observatory and the computation center. I also worked for Dr. Heck cleaning up the Blue Book files
and Blue Book was a complex thing, but they were reporting
to Congress and the question was what happens if Congress raises questions
about the statistics that we're giving them? because they were saying that
essentially the problem was could be explained if you give us a little bit more money we'll go explain the last 2%
of the data that isn't clear and they realized that from our research that 
that wouldn't work very very long so Dr. HK and I had spent three days that I
will never forget at Wright Patterson Air Force Base meeting with the team
from Blue Book. Captain at the time and later Major
Hector Quintanillaa and his staff, his officers and the people supporting
him. The foreign technology division at Wright Patterson is an impressive
place. And then as a result of that they
agreed to give us a very small contract to give me a very small contract to work
with the files and they would send me in to Chicago every month a bundle of
current files from the last month or two. I would go through that and I would
check their interpretation of the file and then if there was something that I
disagree with, we would discuss how they should be classified. None
of the files were classified contrary to what you read every day in UFO books or
blue book files were never classified. There were a few dozen cases that were
classified because of the location or the instruments being used, but not
about the UFO itself. So I began studying the documents
month by month by month. I read everything and occasionally I consulted
colleagues about way the w the witnesses.

The UFO research is like the real
estate business. the three major components are location, location, and
location. And it's like buying a house. The location here is close to the border, just just north of a border between Louisiana and Arkansas.
And the closest town is Hannesville, Louisiana, but the witnesses were in a car uh just north of the state line in
Arkansas. The only significant cities around are Shriport to the southwest and Texana in
the northwest each about 40 miles away. Uh, and the site is about a 100 miles
souths southwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The date was December 10,
1966. So, this is not like the cases you hear
about on television that somebody thinks that they know somebody who saw something last month. And so we we we
have the data and as you'll see we have the data with high precision all the way
along which is not a common experience with UFOs. There was a family of four in
a car. They were driving north at about 20 uh 20 hours and 30 minutes CST at a
location, 1200 yards west of Highway 79,
3.6 miles north of Hanesville, about one mile north of the border with Arkansas.
And you have a red spot at the location. The weather was bad.
So this again, this is not your, you know, popular UFO case. Uh they were
not in an F18 chasing something. Uh there was no radar coverage. They were
in a very large forest. It was raining.
The weather was bad. The temperature was barely above freezing. You could see a
few miles in every direction, but it was raining softly with limited visibility.
Um, you can see why the case has been of no interest by any TV network ever since
ever since 1966. The scene is very ordinary and dull.
What impressed me was the precision of the details when I read the the thing
that the air force has sent me. Um the witnesses had seen an intense light
in the forest under the rain pulsating from white to orange.
It appeared to be over a mile away from them. Yet it was intense.
And um they the the driver after stopping to evaluate the situation
started the car again and drove away to keep his family safe. He was just afraid
of of what it was. reported the case to the air force immediately
and um they spoke to him but they thought it was just a light and after
all it wasn't flying so it was not technically a UFO
it would be a UAP today but in those days it wasn't technically
a UFO so they didn't do much with it um I read
the the file. I got a map like this.
Found that the site was a very large industrial forest owned by the
Wirehouser Corporation and
um for the wood business of course um and but the exact place wasn't found and
it wasn't found for many months. I showed the case um
you know the the other cases that they had sent me you know were not very
significant and I processed them but then I I thought I would show the case
to Dr. Heinneck. This is at Northwestern the astronomy department. I was some of
the programming I was doing was maintaining the bright star catalog for
American astronomy and um Dr. Hennis on on the right was one of the American
astronauts and the the others were uh professors of astronomy at Northwestern
on on the faculty. Um, and I Heck thought, "Yes, I mean,
this is a case we should follow up and we should call uh Major Quintonella to
get permission to uh reinvestigate the case and call the witness."
Um, Major Quintanella agreed and I uh called the the the witness. His name was
uh Galloway, Dr. Louie Galloway,
age 31. His wife was 28. They had two children in the car with them.
Dr. Galloway turned out to be a physics professor at Centenary College in
Shrefport specializing in atomic physics.
And he told me that well he he had
actually done something that any of us would have done. He stopped the car
and he looked at the distance from his headlights
whose power he obviously knew compared to the power of the faraway
light. and he found energy in the range of a
nuclear power station, which is why he got
started the car again and drove his family out of there as fast as he could.
That was interesting because Dr. Hinck and I had been the first two scientists
asked to testify before the Condan Commission. Dr. Condan
had gotten a million dollars. Actually, that got larger as time went on to
re-examine the files of Project Blue Book because the Air Force wanted to get
out of the UFO business. And um they were right. I mean, at the time, you
know, there was a lot of tension in the world. Uh if you're an Air Force officer, you want to fly a jet
somewhere. You don't want to be stuck behind the desk with um people, I don't
know, families calling you about the light in the sky. So, and it wasn't
really uh at the time, you know, we wanted the Air Force to continue, of course,
because we were getting interesting data, but it was completely justified for the Air Force to want to get out of
the business. The
problem was uh so we we we called professor Condan who himself as you know
um an atomic physicist who had been at Trinity with Dr. Oenheimer at the time
of the first atomic bomb. Condan was professor of nuclear physics at the
University of Colorado and he got on the phone with the witness following Michael
to him and um he became fascinated with the case which is why it is mentioned in
the final report of the Condan Commission of the University of Colorado
to the Academy of Sciences in the United States. You haven't read that. You the reason
you haven't read that was that the conclusion of Dr. Condan was that there
was no big scientific interest in studying UFOs at the time. This was
1968. There were lots of other problems in science that were more pressing. Um and
um however uh the in the appendix to the report
there were four pages about this case and I'll go into the what the findings
were um because Dr. Condan had um
sent um two of his um scientists, both of them, one a PhD
in physics, one is in uh psychology
to the uh to meet with the witnesses and they confirmed that the sighting was in
this very large forest that you can see on on this map.
So, um they did extensive follow-up studies
uh including aerial surveys. They they sent uh airplanes equipped with um
infrared equipment at night to fly over the site. Uh they spent several days
with the witnesses looking through the forest trying to find the site. They
didn't find it. Um but Condan um
then again followed up with with the help of the air force. The air force got
involved again based on on my report to them that this particular case was that
they had missed the the analysis of the case and that there was more to it. So
everybody started getting involved. uh Dr. Hinek and I had been the first
two scientists to present the history of UFOs to the Condan Commission for two
days. So we knew the the participants we knew and I had shared my database of
cases which in part came from France and and from Europe with um with the uh Dr.
Sanders who was a statistician uh a professional statistician on the
staff of the Condan Commission. So we were all friends and we're all
working on on on this case. Um
they published their conclusions um that the case was unidentified in their
report as I said to the academy um
the um but the it's only after the the
the publication of the of their book that the witnesses were able to find the
exact place. Now once they found the exact place, you could redo the
calculations of energy of course with more precision. So they were driving on
on the road that you see there US79 and the you can see the distance during
which they had the object in view through the forest.
not a perfect view because again it was raining and you know there was water in
the atmosphere and so um and um in in uh
when the investigation went back to the uh to the site they found that there was
a railroad there and somebody said well maybe it was a locomotive with a big
light and they exaggerated the light Well, that road wirehouser told us that
that line hadn't been used for the last 10 years. It was a line to harvest the
uh the trees, but it it wasn't used anymore.
So um we uh redid with the help of uh
Luke Dini and and the commission in in Paris we uh redid some of the
calculations. Um I had also gotten the the weather
data and in most UFO cases very people don't know the temperature. They don't
know that there are lots of weather details they didn't know. Uh we got data
from two different u meteorological stations in one in the state of Arkansas
and one in the state of uh um in the state of Louisiana. And these are the
every 20 minutes the the the weather conditions at in in the general area.
You see it's close to freezing but just above freezing which enabled the the the
rain. You can see here one of the photographs one of the infrared photographs from the the uh the jets
that they sent that Condan had sent there. So it's a very complete case
that's essentially unknown in the literature.
Um the um Condan and Galloway had done the
calculations and they disagreed. Uh Professor Condan again who was had been
at Trinity found energy twice what the
local what Dr. Galloway had found which puts it in the range of a um
you know a good size modern nuclear nuclear station.
Um there was a major in the air force who was himself a specialist in atomic
physics. As you'd expect, the Air Force would have physicists understood atomic explosions. And he
found a number. He did his own calculations. Major Ryan, he found his
uh his own calculations in the range. The the study that was done in Paris
found also uh about looked at different hypotheses about the actual geometry of
the situation different from what Condan and others had done. And um so we have
as of as we stand today, we have a wide range of energies that certainly exceed
what you would expect from a small object that was estimated to be about 3
m in diameter. It was again a glowing sphere that was pulsating from orange to
white. Okay. during the for minutes for
a number a long number of minutes during the uh observation
the um the results of uh the team
uh and and these are the two models that that we were developed in Paris uh a few
months ago. Um again those those results
comparing the light from the headlights to the distance and the light from the
object give you those those estimates and our paper which again is is
available um goes into the detail of of the
calculations and I don't have time to to go into that. So
Dr. Condan in his report mentions it and but he says after all it was on the
ground and it doesn't qualify as a flying object. What the witnesses later
canvased the area and they found four families in the that range of a couple
of weeks before and after who had seen exceptional lights of exceptional
intensity in the air and moving around there. Of course, I had not
reported it. Most UFO witnesses do not report a UFO for a number of reasons.
they're running uh you know a clothing store uh or they
are employed by the electrical company or they are a judge somewhere. They're
not going to be caught on TV making somebody making fun of them because
they've seen this extraordinary light that nobody else has seen. Well, uh they
found these four other observations and two of them were very much in the range
of their observation and gave gave them again a time illuminosity and so on that
was in the range of what they so I won't bore you with those details but it's all
again in in our paper. Well um
what about the trees? uh you know we're in an industrial forest in a commercial forest.
Um and it's it's all pine trees. I mean
there are no no other types of trees. uh they want trees that they can cut and
sell to the market for building houses and for um wood chips and for everything
else that you can do with wood pulp and everything else. So it's a it's a big
industrial operation that's very wellrun. Uh wirehousers all over the world uh you
know dealing with wood products. Um
well this happened in a clearing. The clearing was not big that which is
why they didn't find it at the beginning. The clearing is uh maybe 10 m
wide. All the trees around the clearing had
been quote burned by the object.
Those are my witnesses. The trees the the trees were a living organism and
they absorbed the radiation. This is not heat. This is radiation
and the radiation is written into the b of the tree.
Well, Dr. Galloway knew that. So he collected
these um pieces of wood and he sent them to a government laboratory
uh to ask them to examine it with their advanced equipment.
Uh the government laboratory uh returned the the bark with no comment
essentially. Again, I mean, you work for the government. You don't want to be caught dealing with something that may
be unexplainable and so on and ruin your
career as a government scientist. And this was about the strange light in a
forest. I mean, come on. Um, so I I Dr. Galloway told me that I I
asked him if I could have the bark. He said, "Sure." So, um, I've had the bark
for a long time. The reason I didn't bring it to a lab is
that the the typical analysis would have cut into the
wood and um, of course with destruction of some of the potential data in there.
And I I waited until there were techniques that would allow uh the the
examination of the wood without destroying the uh the samples.
Um
the question is can we go back to the forest now and uh again uh you know get
more information from the trees. Unfortunately um you know they cut those
trees and they sell them. They they take them to the market. This is not a forest
for taking your kids for a picnic. And so you you can see and Paul Heinek was
helped me in uh in getting the latest information from way Hower and this is
the latest aerial photograph of the of the forest which is obviously closely
monitored. And um we cannot go back to the to the site uh now but we do have
the the bark um
the the logical step and that's where I will end this part is uh further
analysis of the bark with extremely fine experiments And uh
we've started um talking to um to people who
um have um uh experience with that uh um
with analyzing um either fabric or uh material that
cannot be cut into like the uh the the cloth. from tin the
tur and those are the people that I'd like to try to reach and involve in the u uh
in the analysis because we you know just like you cannot cut a
piece of the the touring shroud u I I'd rather not cut into the samples we have
because from the analysis that uh Luke Dini and his team have done at Slay
Atomic Center in France. We think that the there is information
in layers deposited by the energy inside the tree as the object was pulsing.
Remember that the first observation from Dr. Galloway was that the object was
pulsing from white to white to orange.
Uh and the the great intensity was when it was white. Now if we can if if we can
study those different layers in terms of the energy that was coupled into the
bark um then we may learn something more you
know about this kind of object. Um
but remember from the comparisons um we uh we are dealing with a source of
energy in a clearing on a quiet evening
uh in Arkansas with an object that's no more than two or three meters in diameter
that's developing the energy of um um you or three mile island.
How come nobody knows that? Again, and you had four pages in the
official report of the Condan Commission to the Academy of Sciences of the United
States. So I think what it takes to do good UFO research is not to chase
ambulances but to look carefully at the history going back to the 60s or the
50s. If you have good data and bring that up to the next phase and of course
the next phase now is going to be looking at the wood that has been preserved. Okay. There is another good
reason for looking at cases before the 70s
and it's simply that um after the 70s
UFOs started to be used. I mean the consensus certainly in the United States
and most other countries was that again the the condent committee had said that
there was no big interest for science in a few unexplained lights.
So various agencies started using UFOs
as an explanation for their experiments
that were classified around the world.
So when some farmer somewhere saw something like you know it looked like a
disc and it was running it was flying around and maybe it was dropping
something uh and or maybe it was crashing and uh the there was a force
central recovery. The explanation to that farmer would be, well, it's one of
those UFOs, you know, it probably comes from Mars. So, um, a number of us started, that
doesn't mean that you shouldn't study UFO cases after 1970.
It means that before you study the case, there are a number of hard questions you
have to ask about the location. Who was there? Was there military
interest? Was there intelligence interest? Was it at a time of maybe a
coup in Moscow somewhere? Um maybe um a
revolution in Latin America. Well, could it be connected to something else that
was in the news at the time? And then if you find that, you won't know the real
answer, but you can you can then approach the case with a different set
of questions. Um, before 1970, you can ask just the questions we asked. you
know, uh, in this case, we were lucky to have a a witness who was a smart atomic
physicist that we could introduce to Condan because Professor Condan had money to study UFOs
at the time. So, we took advantage of that coincidence in history to bring you
this case. Now, the questions um and I'm, you know,
I'm open to questions, but I have some questions of my own.
Um most of you probably think that um
project blue book was BS. Essentially, there was another project. Okay, everybody knows that. Everybody's known
that for a long time. There was another project. It was classified. It came from the Robertson panel in 1953.
Um, and it it went on and the idea was, you know, the data we get from the
public is very inconsistent. You know, we need good data. So, we're
going to do instrumentation beyond and beyond that, we're about to launch satellites in a few years. So uh let's
be serious and let's let's bring science and instrumentation into it. And of
course it will be done by you know the usual uh companies Battel and Lo and a
few others that that we deal with all the time because we have classified
contracts with their teams and we trust them and they do advanced physics. So,
um, in the meantime, um, you know, the the
American population pays taxes and they want to know if they are properly
protected. So if they see a light in the forest, they should have a place where
they can at least report it and um and have
um have a um a chance to if it's
if it's new and interesting that somebody's going to go to the site with them and investigate it. So uh that was
project blue book but it was very much shot in the dark. I mean there were yes
uh when when I read the statistics of blue book there were immediately 75% of
the cases that that could be explained could be explained just by consulting
tables of satellites consulting tables of whether uh the moon the major planets
and so on. Um however there was a residue and within
that residue there were about 5% that could not be readily identified without
site investigation and those were the the basis for the
database that I was building and I was finding patterns in that database um
just like Mik Vayor has has done in in France and continues to do in France
with the French databases and people around the world have been doing that and those patterns are repeatable which
is what you're looking for in science except that we don't understand what
image and what phenomenon they are reporting to us. So this is where we are
and the air force both in this case and in the earlier case that Dr. Nolan and I
published um which was um a case in the north of
the United States. The Air Force was involved. In fact, in our case, they
they gave up on the case, uh, deciding it wasn't one of their aircraft that had
caused the uh the the deposit of of metal
infusion on a on the park. Uh, metal that we
recovered and we've studied in the lab. Um but then they came back later and
they said can we get involved in your investigation again and again those were
people with labs behind them and with degrees in physics and they were serious
just like in this case the air force of course got very interested about the
the power of the observation. So, uh, no, Blue Book was not BS. Uh, uh, Blue
Book was a wide ranging survey of what everybody was seeing and reporting. And
some of the data was uh, interesting for science. For one
thing, they collected data from the Navy, including naval officers reports
of objects coming out of the ocean uh that we're talking about here now. So
those uh those cases were on record and when I I punched up all those uh cards
from Project Blue Book, there were several hundred cases that came from naval officers at sea. So this wasn't
just the United States. This was from the Pacific, the Atlantic, uh you know
the uh the North Sea and and and and other places all over the world from
naval ships. Okay. So those are the things that from history that we all
need to keep in mind as we move forward into this new great era that uh that we
have. Thank you very much.
